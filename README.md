BlogReaderTreehouseApp
======================
This is my second iPhone app. It was created with the help of Treehouse.com (teamtreehouse.com). I used some of
their tutorials to get the hang of the iOS SDK. Inside is a simple blog reader that can pull up any blog and parse
data to dispay said post in the app.
